# Data analysis for the Burning Homes and Structural Materials project
Contains the code used during the data analysis of the BHASMA research project at CSU.

## What is BHASMA?
BHASMA is a project aimed to develop a deeper understanding of the pollution emitted from houses during a fire. Particularly with a focus on houses located on wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs) which have been facing a larger quantity and severity of wildfires. The main goal is to develop an emission factor inventory for a variety of materials commonly used in housing. Most of these are poorly understood and as such this is one of the first studies to ever analyze the emissions of some of these materials. 

## Experimental info
These experiments were done by myself as well as many other wonderful people on the research team, including Dr. Shantanu Jathar (my advisor), Dr. Christian L'Orange, and Kevin Ridgway. We performed a total of 85 experiments across 26 different materials, ranging from common woods used in housing, to different insulation types, to asphalt shingles used for roofing. Each of these materials was tested under both pyrolysis and flaming combustion condidtions. We then took a variety of samples of the smoke emitted from the materials and analyzed these samples for a variety of chemical species.

## What's contained in this repository?
This repository is specifically for the work that I have done on this project, which has been focused on the data analysis leading up to the emission factor inventory. Most of this work is detailed in EmissionFactors.Rmd which contains all of the R code used to take our raw data received and turn it into the emission factor inventory.
